This project will end up being a multiplayer minesweeper with built-in chat. 
A Node.js server is included.

SERVER:
To get a functional server, you need node.js installed. It can be downloaded 
and compiled from nodejs.org, and there are plenty of guides online for that.
Then run server.js in node ($ node server.js), and point your browser to 
localhost:8080.
